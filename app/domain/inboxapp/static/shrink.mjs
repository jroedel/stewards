// shrink is what the send screen does to a photo before sending it: nothing,
// for a photo already within MAX_SIDE, and otherwise a JPEG scaled down to
// it, turned upright, with the original's EXIF.
//
// Why on the phone and not on the server: what costs is the trip. A 50 MP
// photo is 15 to 25 MB on one bar of signal, and the server's work on it
// (decoding at full size) is exactly what nearly ran the shared host out of
// memory; see foundation/imaging. Shrunk here, the phone sends about 3 MB and
// the server decodes 12 MP at most.
//
// The rule that governs every branch below: when in any doubt, send the
// original. The server takes any photo up to 25 MB and 60 MP, and turns it
// upright itself, so the original is never wrong -- only slower. A shrunk
// photo that came out sideways, or without its date, would be wrong, and
// nobody would notice until they sorted it.
//
// The parts that are plain bytes are in jpeg.mjs and tested under Node; this
// file is the part that needs a browser, and is tested in one
// (shrink_browser_test.mjs).
