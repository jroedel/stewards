// Handler reports readiness by checking the schema the running binary expects,
// not by pinging the database.
//
// The difference is the whole point, and it is inherited from a silent outage
// in the sibling project. A rollback restores the binary and not the database.
// The old binary's CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS is a no-op, so it starts
// cleanly; its health check was a ping, so the probe answered 200; and every
// real request then failed on a column that no longer existed. The deploy saw
// a healthy service and kept it.
//
// So a deploy that rolls the binary back onto a newer schema must fail *here*,
// loudly, while the previous binary is still one rename away.
//
// The response body is deliberately incurious. /healthz is reachable by
// anybody, so the detail -- which table, which column -- goes to the log,
// where the person debugging it can see it and a stranger cannot.
