// OAuth is a second way to hand a program an API key: instead of a steward
// copying one off the keys screen into a file, the program sends them here to
// agree, and is given the key itself. It exists for Claude on claude.ai and
// its phone app, which have no file to hold a key in and can only connect to
// a server that signs in this way. The program gets nothing a key made on the
// screen would not give it -- the key is an ordinary one, listed on that
// screen and revoked from it -- so everything apikey.go says about what a key
// can do applies unchanged.
//
// A grant is the authorization code: the steward agreed, and this is the
// one-time proof of it that the program trades for the key. It is a sign-in
// link in all but who carries it, and is kept the same way.
//
// # One key per program, and no refresh token
//
// Connecting a program again replaces the key it was given before rather than
// adding one: a steward who reconnects Claude a few times should not find the
// five-key limit used up by keys nothing holds any more.
//
// The key lasts as long as one made on the screen, ninety days, and then the
// program must ask the steward again. OAuth would have a short-lived token and
// a refresh token that is swapped for a new one each time; that is a second
// credential to store, rotate and revoke, for a program that a steward can
// reconnect in two taps four times a year. If the asking ever becomes a
// nuisance, a refresh token is the place to start.
