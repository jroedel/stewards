// ID is an opaque identifier: 16 random bytes, written as 32 lowercase hex
// characters.
//
// Random rather than sequential, taken from mass-intentions. A sequential id
// tells anybody holding one how many exist and lets them ask for the next.
// Here it is also what Phase 2 and 3 attach to -- a photo, a plant, a drone
// frame -- so it must never change, which is why a place has an ID as well as
// the slug people see in its address.
//
// Not a UUID. A UUIDv4 carries 122 bits of randomness in 36 characters with
// four hyphens and a version nibble that says nothing useful here, and it
// would be a dependency or a hand-rolled layout. This is 128 bits in 32
// characters with a parser that refuses everything else.
//
// An ID is safe to log and safe to show. It identifies a row; it never
// authorises anything.

// predictable bytes. An `(ID, error)` signature here would be a nil check at
// every call site guarding a branch that cannot be taken.

// field, a database column.
//
// Strict about case as well as alphabet. hex.DecodeString accepts upper case,

// strings, and a value used as a map key and a database key must have exactly
// one spelling.
