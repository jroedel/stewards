// Email is an address whose shape has been checked, normalised for use as an

// "Checked" is the honest word rather than "valid". Whether an address can
// receive mail is not knowable from its text, and the only test that settles
// it is sending something -- which this service does anyway, since signing in
// means clicking a link that arrived. So the job here is to catch a typo and
// to refuse anything that could do damage further along, not to adjudicate
// RFC 5322.

// bare bracketed address, and a quoted local part with spaces in it. All three
// are correct for a mail header and wrong for a field labelled "Email": a
// display name means storing something that is not an address, and then
// mailing a sign-in link to a string nobody can read.
//
// # Why the whole address is lower-cased
//
// RFC 5321 makes the local part case-sensitive, so in principle Steward@ and
// steward@ may be different people. In practice no provider works that way, and
// the cost of honouring the standard is that one person signing in as Steward@
// and later as steward@ gets two accounts, each with its own sessions --
// discovered as "my permissions disappeared". Folding is the lesser wrong, and
// it is what makes an address usable as a unique key.
//
// The consequence to know about: an address that really does depend on the
// case of its local part cannot hold an account here.
