# The target is shared hosting with no root, no systemd and no Docker: ssh,
# cron and a static binary are what everything here is built out of. Adapted
# from mass-intentions' deploy.sh, which paid for most of what follows; where a
# step is here because of something that went wrong there, the comment says so.

# Run from CI on every push to main, and by a person through `make deploy`,
# `make deploy-htaccess` and the `make prod-*` targets. Never by an agent
# (CLAUDE.md section 6; .claude/settings.json denies it).
#
# There is no separate one-time install, unlike mass-intentions. Everything an
# install would do -- the directories, the supervisor, cron, the front end --
# is idempotent and runs on every deploy, so the first push to main is the
# install, and a server rebuilt from nothing is one re-run of the workflow away.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ backup and rollback

# backup_script prints the shell that copies the database, and snapshots the
# photo files, for a caller to run on the server while the app is stopped.
#
# Stopped, because a live SQLite database in WAL mode keeps its latest writes
# in the -wal file, and a copy of the .db alone opens perfectly and is missing
# them. A clean shutdown checkpoints the WAL into the .db, so the copy taken
# afterwards is whole; the -wal is copied too, in case the shutdown was not
# clean. sqlite3's .backup is used when the host has it, and is safe either way.
#
# The photos are snapshotted with hard links, not copied. photofs writes every
# file whole to a temporary name and renames it into place, and never opens
# one to change it, so a file once written is never modified: a link to it in
# a snapshot is as good as a copy, and costs a directory entry rather than
# the photo's size again. What a snapshot keeps is a photo that is later
# removed -- discarded, pruned, or taken away by a release with a bug in it --
# for as many backups as the database is kept. It is on the same disk, so it
# is no defence against losing the server; that copy is a person's to take.
# A snapshot that fails warns and carries on: the database's backup is the
# one a deploy must not go without.
#
# photo-files is where the app keeps them unless config.toml says otherwise
# ([photos] dir), and the config.toml scripts/secrets writes never does.
#
# A snippet rather than a remote call of its own, so that it can run inside the
# same locked command as the stop and the swap -- see cmd_deploy. No `exit` in

# cmd_mail_report is how cron and mail are set up on the account, and what the
# domains it uses publish in DNS: everything needed to decide why cron's
# emails are filed as spam, with no secret in it.
#
# Two halves, on two machines. The server's half is deploy/mail-report.sh,
# piped to `bash -s` so that nothing is installed there; it reads and prints,
# redacted. The DNS half runs here, on the domains the server's half named,
# because public DNS needs no ssh and is answered the same from anywhere.
#
# DKIM is the one record DNS cannot list: a key lives at
# <selector>._domainkey.<domain>, and there is no asking which selectors
# exist. So the common ones are tried, along with konsoleH's habit of
# "default" and a year and month, and SELECTOR=<s> adds one read from a
# message's DKIM-Signature (s=...).

		== reading it
		   An email passes DMARC when SPF or DKIM passes FOR THE DOMAIN IN ITS FROM.
		   SPF is checked against the envelope sender ("Mailed by" in Gmail), and
		   DKIM against the signing domain ("Signed by"). A From at the host name
		   with neither aligned is what Gmail learns to file as spam.

		   The definitive answer is in one message: in Gmail on a computer, open
		   a cron email, More (three dots), Show original. The SPF, DKIM and
		   DMARC lines at the top say pass or fail, and for which domain.
