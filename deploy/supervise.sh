# Keep the server running, without systemd.
#
# The target is a konsoleH account with no root and no user D-Bus, so
# `systemctl --user` cannot work. Supervision is cron plus this script: `start`
# is idempotent and is the @reboot line, and `watch` -- start, but silent when
# there is nothing to do -- runs every five minutes as the watchdog.
#
# Why watch is silent. Cron emails whatever a job prints, so a watchdog that
# says "already running as 86229" sends 288 identical emails a day, from root
# at the host, unsigned. That buried the one email that matters -- the app was
# down and has been started, or would not start -- and taught Gmail to file
# every one of them as spam (2026-10-02). watch prints only when it acted or
# failed, so an email from it is news.
#
# Taken from mass-intentions, less its rehearsal instance, and with one
# difference that matters on a shared crontab: this script takes no instance
# argument. mass-intentions' deploy removes every cron line matching
# "supervise.sh start production" before writing its own, so a line of ours
# in that shape would be deleted by the other project's next deploy.
