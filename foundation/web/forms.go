// --- where a write came from ------------------------------------------------

// SameOriginOnly refuses a write that a page of this site did not make.
//
// Taken from mass-intentions, with one change that matters here. Safe methods
// are not checked: writing is the whole attack, and reading a form tells
// nobody anything.
//
//   - Sec-Fetch-Site is sent by every current browser and page script cannot
//     forge it. same-origin is ours; none means somebody typed the address or
//     used a bookmark. same-site and cross-site are refused.
//   - Where it is absent -- an old browser, or curl -- Origin is compared
//     against origin, the site's own public address.
//   - A request carrying neither is allowed through. That is the hole in this
//     check, and it is deliberate: it is a command-line client rather than a
//     browser being used against somebody, and no browser reaches it.
//
// The change: mass-intentions compares Origin against the request's Host. On
// konsoleH that is wrong, because the .htaccess proxy cannot preserve the
// Host header and every request arrives as Host: 127.0.0.1:<port>. The
// comparison there is only ever reached by a browser too old to send
// Sec-Fetch-Site, so it has never refused a real form -- but here it would, so
// the public origin is configuration instead.
//
// So this is a browser-CSRF control and nothing else. What protects a steward's
// session is that the cookie is SameSite=Lax and this refuses cross-site writes.

// upload endpoint whether or not it was meant to be.

// It can only tighten. http.MaxBytesReader wraps a body, and wrapping a body
// already capped at 64 KB in a reader that allows 10 MB still stops at 64 KB
// -- mass-intentions shipped exactly that, and the symptom was not "too big"
// but a 502 from Apache, which was still writing the upload into a socket the
// server had closed. When photo uploads arrive, their route gets its own limit
// and this one is not wrapped around it.
