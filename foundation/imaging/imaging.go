// Package imaging turns a photo as a phone sends it into the two pictures a
// page shows: a large one and a small one, both JPEG, both the right way up,
// and neither carrying anything the original said about where or how it was
// taken.
//
// That last part is the reason this exists rather than serving the upload.
// A phone photo's EXIF holds the GPS position to a few metres, the phone's
// make and serial-ish identifiers, and the time to the second; a photo of the
// garden is a photo of somebody's house, and before long of volunteers.
// Re-encoding from decoded pixels is the one way to be sure none of it
// survives: there is no list of tags to strip that can be incomplete. The
// original is the caller's to keep or not, privately.
//
// Three things are read from the EXIF before it is dropped, because the
// picture is wrong without them or the form is tedious without them: the
// orientation (a phone held upright saves the pixels sideways and a tag saying
// so), the date it was taken, which the caller can offer as the month, and the
// GPS position, which the caller may keep beside the private original and
// never in a picture it shows.
//
// JPEG and PNG only. iPhones store HEIC, but Safari converts to JPEG on upload
// unless the form asks for HEIC by name, and decoding HEIC in Go would mean a
// C library on a shared host that has none. WebP decodes with x/image, but
// nobody's phone camera produces it, and every format accepted is one more
// decoder facing the internet.
