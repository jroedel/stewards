// Package errs carries an error from wherever it happened out to whatever has
// to answer for it, with two things attached: the status code that answer
// should use, and a sentence a person can act on.
//
// The two are separate because they have different audiences. The status code
// is for the browser and the logs. The sentence is for somebody standing in a
// garden bed with a phone, so it says what to do next and never names a Go
// package, a table or a field that only makes sense to whoever wrote the code.
