// Package sqldb opens the one SQLite database this service uses, and answers
// whether its schema is the one the running binary expects.
//
// The driver is modernc.org/sqlite, which is a dependency because the standard
// library has no SQL driver. Pure Go specifically, rather than the cgo one: the
// release build is CGO_ENABLED=0, so that the artefact is a single file with no
// libc on the server to match against. An ordinary build links the builder's
// glibc and dies on the host with GLIBC_2.xx not found.
//
// Taken from mass-intentions, less what only a store needs. The transaction
// helpers and the constraint-violation readers come back with the first store
// that makes a claim or needs several statements to be atomic, rather than
// sitting here untested until then.
